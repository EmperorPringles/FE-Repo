Legend
======

- Icon Background Color dictates origin:
Sky Blue = Awakening
Green = Jugdral (Either FE4 or FE5)
Pink = Archanea/Valentia (Either FE1/3/11/12 or FE2/15)
Orange = New icon for an item found in-game that does not have any offical art or model
Yellow = Entirely new item
Purple = Icon for a standard item not found in Archanea/Valentia/Ylisse/Valm/Jugdral that has been incorporated
Magenta = Outrealm Items, likely made for something else
Red Outline = Icon needs fixed, is a WIP, is one I'm not happy with, or needs replaced.
Red Bar = Separation between regular weapons/items and Outrealm items

- Names or classes in parentheses indicate limitations on who can wield.
An * after a name indicates a "soft-lock" in that those individuals can use the weapon from base weapon levels whereas other units must meet the requirements.
Characters in [] are assumed to be able to use but are never in such a situation to do so.

- If it uses a ">" in front of it, it is on the sheet.
- If it uses a "-" in front of it, then there is only a placeholder square.

- Multiple items have alternate versions; see notes in [] for details.

- Other notes on items are listed in parentheses.
